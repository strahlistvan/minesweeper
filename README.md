# Minesweeper
My minesweeper web application. There are many minesweeper clones in the Internet, but it's MINE(sweeper).
I used pure JavaScript in this project. (with a little [Vanilla.js](http://http://vanilla-js.com/) ) I also downloaded free images and sounds to the project, so I only make the game logic.
